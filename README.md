# Outline of a Font Commoning Practice

Before I say anything else, I want to address the objection most type designers with have to these ideas:

### “Won't type designers starve?”

I could answer that nobody is forced to be a type designer. Most of us cannot manage to get any money for standing on the street and making faces. But we are not, as a result, condemned to spend our lives standing on the street making faces, and starving. We do something else.

But that is the wrong answer because it accepts the questioner's implicit assumption: that without imposing artificial scarcity on our work, type designers cannot possibly be paid a cent. Supposedly it is all or nothing.

The real reason type designers will not starve is that it will still be possible for them to get paid for designing type; just not paid as much as now. If the OFL becomes the dominant model for digital font licensing, fewer people will be able to get rich selling fonts, but a larger, more diverse group will be able to make a modest living.

This is an outline of how I imagine someone in the near future might find ways to spend their time managing and improving a digital commons of fonts.
